# React Native useEffect Cleanup Inconsistency with Async Operations

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in React Native applications involving the `useEffect` hook and asynchronous operations. The cleanup function within `useEffect` may not always be reliably called, potentially leading to resource leaks or unexpected behavior, especially under rapid state changes or component unmounting.

## The Problem
When an asynchronous operation is initiated within `useEffect`, and the component unmounts before the operation completes, the cleanup function might not execute. This can cause issues such as:

* **Resource leaks:**  Unclosed connections, timers, or other resources that should be released.
* **Unexpected behavior:**  Callback functions might still fire after the component has unmounted.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that any asynchronous operations are properly cancelled or handled within the cleanup function.  This might involve using techniques such as abort controllers or setting flags to prevent actions after the component unmounts.

See `bugSolution.js` for an example implementation.
