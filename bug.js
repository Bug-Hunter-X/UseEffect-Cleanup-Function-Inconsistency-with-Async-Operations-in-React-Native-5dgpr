This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation inside. The cleanup function within `useEffect` might not be called properly, leading to unexpected behavior, especially when the component unmounts quickly or during rapid state changes.  For instance:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('someUrl');
    // ... process response ...
  };

  fetchData();

  return () => {
    // Cleanup function (might not be called reliably)
    console.log('Cleanup function called');
  };
}, []);
```
